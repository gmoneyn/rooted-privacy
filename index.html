        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Rooted - Plant Care Tracker &middot; Effective February 20, 2026</p>

        <p>Rooted ("we", "our", or "the app") is a plant care tracker for iOS developed by Grant Nelick. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data the app collects, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

        <h2>1. Data That Stays on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All of your plant data, care schedules, journal entries, photos, and settings are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not operate any servers, and your personal plant data is never uploaded, synced, or shared with anyone.</p>

        <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
        <p>Rooted can use your location to display local weather information and provide weather-based care suggestions (e.g., skip watering when it's raining). Location use is entirely optional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GPS Location:</strong> If you enable "Use My Location," the app requests coarse location access (city-level accuracy) to fetch weather data. Your coordinates are sent to OpenWeatherMap's API solely to retrieve weather information. We do not store or track your location history.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual City Search:</strong> You can manually search for and select a city instead of using GPS. The city name you enter is sent to OpenWeatherMap's geocoding API to find matching locations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can disable location access at any time in the app's Settings or in iOS Settings.</p>

        <h2>3. Weather Data</h2>
        <p>Rooted uses the <a href="https://openweathermap.org" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> free API to fetch current weather and short-term forecasts. The only data sent to OpenWeatherMap is your selected location's coordinates (latitude and longitude). Please refer to <a href="https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how they handle this data.</p>

        <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
        <p>Rooted displays ads through Google AdMob to support the app as a free product. Google AdMob may collect and use certain device and usage data to serve relevant ads. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>General usage and interaction data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can remove all ads permanently through a one-time in-app purchase ("Remove Ads"). Once purchased, AdMob is fully disabled and no ad-related data collection occurs.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">how Google uses data from apps that use their services</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The "Remove Ads" in-app purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, process, or store any payment or financial information.</p>

        <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
        <p>Rooted can send local push notifications to remind you about plant care tasks. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.</p>

        <h2>7. Photos</h2>
        <p>You can add photos to your plants from your device's photo library. These images are stored locally within the app's data on your device. They are never uploaded or shared externally.</p>

        <h2>8. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
        <p>Rooted does not include any first-party analytics, tracking, or telemetry. We do not use Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar services. The only third-party SDK in the app is Google AdMob (for advertising), which can be disabled via the Remove Ads purchase.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Rooted is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>10. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. Deleting the app removes all associated data. There is nothing stored on our servers to delete because we don't have any servers.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

        <h2>12. Contact</h2>
